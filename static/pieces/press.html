        <p>"Great art demands total commitment. Band Without Hands has that -- plus a frontwoman that can’t be beat. The energy in the room peaked with this punk band. But punk? A better genre for the band would be… Aggression? No, too much joy in their sound. Freedom? Is that a genre? Loud, a little angry and a lot of fun. (Bonus points: toy ray gun, singing through a megaphone, covering Boston band the Atlantics.)"</p>

        <p>"Band Without Hands just blasted through their Rumble set with the fury of 1,000 suns. The band rose to the occasion in a big way, delivering a crowd pleasing performance for the growing throng at TT’s."</p>

        <p>"When it was all said and done, all four bands — Mister Vertigo, the Rare Occasions, Band Without Hands, and Nemes — brought their A-game and could have easily been announced as the night’s winners without anyone raising an eyebrow or blazing out a few angry tweets at the judges." "After the Rare Occasions were done flashing us bedroom eyes, Band Without Hand’s loud-noise orgy took us to a climax without any necessary foreplay. Their raw, blistering set was aided by megaphones, toy guns and matching white suits, but it was electric front woman Jess Jacobs who kept eyes front and center. They also provided the night’s highlight, a cover of the Atlantics’ “Lonelyhearts”, which is this writer’s most favorite song to ever come out of Boston. So, bonus points for that. It’s fine to play a cover at the Rumble, but only when it’s the most perfect choice."</p>
